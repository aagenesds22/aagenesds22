🔭 I have 1 year of programming experience, including web applications written in React, API endpoints, SQL databases, NoSQL databases and also knowledge in Python. I can 
easily get along with intercultural teams without any language constraint as I can speak English, Spanish and Portugues with fluidity. I like to share my ideas and knowledge and I am able 
to attend work in full-time flexibility.

📝 I love the tech world because I enjoy finding all possible solutions and optimizations to random problems in software and also, because it is a skill that soon will become
necessary to master in order to adapt to a better and more developed civilization. Life is about changes, and change requires commitment. That's what I feel when I code.
