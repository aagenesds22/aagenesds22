🔭 I'm a UNIX soldier, can't imagine my life without sittin' in front of a UNIX based terminal. Without UNIX, everything is creepy. But also, I'm a software engineer with a tendency to occupy back-end roles. I can perform very good on front-end too. Along my career I have been building pretty cool applications, mantaining others and designing back-end architectures which is my main passion.

📝 I love the tech world because I enjoy finding all possible solutions and optimizations to random problems in software and also, because it is a skill that soon will become
necessary to master in order to adapt to a better and more developed civilization. Life is about changes, and change requires commitment. That's what I feel when I code.
